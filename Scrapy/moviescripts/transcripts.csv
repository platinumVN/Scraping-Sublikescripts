The implication,is, you reap what you sow.,We are simply delivering it back to them,and saying, ""We don't want this."",The letter was from an unknown group,called the Dark Harvest Commandos,,and their first target was,this secret research facility,in Wiltshire.,Inside this ordinary-looking building,,scientists work with some of,the most dangerous substances,in the world. It's Porton Down,,the Ministry of Defence's,chemical defence establishment.,Porton Down was one of the most,secretive places in Britain,,and was closely guarded.,They were on the alert,,and they did an initial search,of their premises and found nothing.,They checked again, and this bucket,was found outside the perimeter.,The bucket was filled with soil,,but according to their letter,,this soil also contained a,deadly agent of germ warfare.,Bacillus anthracis.,Better known as ""anthrax"".,A Government minister said today,that the whole country had been,put at risk as the result of an,environmentalist group's protest.,The group dumped a sample of soil,,which they claimed,was contaminated with anthrax,,near the perimeter,of the Porton Down biological,research station, in Wiltshire.,First thing that they did is deny it.,They said it's a hoax,,it's not really anything,to alarm the public about,,there's no public risk here.,Those scientists at the,station are conducting tests,on the package of soil.,We understand that they,think it's very unlikely,that there's any anthrax in the sample.,Anthrax is a naturally,occurring but deadly organism.,In the Bible, it was one of,the ten plagues of Egypt,,and any outbreak can,have fatal consequences.,The bacterium forms spores.,If they're in the air,and you breathe them in,and they get into your respiratory,system or get into your lungs,,the little seeds will,germinate into bacteria,,the bacteria will start to grow,,and then they start producing nasty,things which will cause you to die.,It's pretty lethal.,On the skin, blisters,,often with very black spots,,look very ugly.,Swellings, flu-like symptoms -,you're getting the whole works.,You're getting nausea,,you're getting hoarseness,,you're getting bloody vomit,,abdominal pains,,bloody diarrhoea, septicaemia, meningitis.,Some pretty horrific,ways to die from anthrax.,In a rabbit, symptoms,will appear in about 18 hours.,In a man, about 24. In a child,,perhaps a little sooner.,If you can imagine the tissues swelling.,You start bleeding,from the inside out,,so it's really quite unpleasant.,The suspect soil that,the Dark Harvest protesters left,outside Porton Down was brought,into the facility for analysis,,and Government scientists,quickly established,it came from over 600 miles away.,Gruinard Island...,..sitting just a,mile from the mainland,in the far northwest of the British Isles.,It's a place that holds many secrets.,I've come a long way to visit,that island lying out there,in its lonely sea loch.,Hereabouts, they call it the,Island of Death, the Mystery Island.,But in the years before,the Second World War,,Gruinard Bay was a peaceful place.,The island had been,uninhabited since the Clearances,,but was overlooked by a,scattering of mainland villages,,which in the pre-tourist era were home,to God-fearing, Gaelic-speaking,crofter folk.,Now, this is not a story of old, dark deeds,or Highland superstition.,No, this story started in 1942.,In the early years of the Second World War,,the Northwest Highlands were,strategically important -,sparsely populated and,far away from enemy eyes.,The British Army arrived in droves.,There were battleships in the bay,,armoured cars in the ditches,and a warm welcome in the villages,of Laide, Aultbea,,Gairloch and Ullapool.,The area was changed,completely during the war years.,A huge amount of activity.,I mean, as a kid,,you loved seeing all the,things that were happening.,Soldiers crawling everywhere.,Operations on the island,were shrouded in secrecy,,and the locals were kept at a distance.,It was secretive. We knew there,was something going on there.,And there was a barrier across the road,,people in white suits going to the island.,There was that feeling that,there was things happening,,that people weren't sure what was going on.,I was working on the farm along,there, opposite the island,,and I was seeing them back and forth,with the cattle and the sheep.,They ferried them right,across to the island.,What were these scientists up,to on the island, do you think?,I couldn't very well tell,you what they were up to.,I was seven or eight.,We were going to Ullapool,in the car, passing the island...,..and when we came to Gruinard,,there were sort of puffs in the air.,A few little explosions going off.,But just on this near the part,of the island, on this side,,there were several of them,,and they were little,sort of puffs in the air.,What on earth is it?,What are they doing there?,There were rumours and whispers about,what might be going on on the island,,but over on the mainland,,disturbing things began to happen.,My brother went out about,eight o'clock in the morning.,First of all, he went to the barn,,and he found one of,the cows dead in the stall.,He came in to tell my father.,Then he went down to the hill,to have a look at the sheep,,and he found eight dead.,Follow me.,This is the community church in Aultbea.,Please come in.,Danny Grant is an elder,in the local church.,As a child, he witnessed,something he'll never forget.,I actually saw it with my own eyes -,a big horse dumped in,this hole, with the legs...,Rigour mortis had set in, so that...,I remember having to cut...,They cut the legs off the horse.,That wasn't a very pretty thing,for children to be watching,,but we all...,I remember seeing this.,And then telling the adults about,all they sheep lying in the fields,with their legs in the air,,and they're all dead.,Maybe a dozen or more.,Within hours, I believe,,they were finding cows.,And people were obviously alarmed.,I lost one horse, and I,lost six or seven sheep.,Now, what happened to these animals?,Have you any idea at all?,Well, I'm sure they would be poisoned.,Scientists at Porton Down in Wiltshire,are carrying out tests,on the package of soil,contaminated with anthrax spores,,which was dumped at the,chemical defence establishment,by a Scottish protest group.,It's taken three days of tests here,at the public health laboratories,to confirm that anthrax,spores were in the soil,,which was dumped on the perimeter,of the Government's defence establishment.,We've shown that there,is anthrax in the soil.,It could be dangerous, but under,very unusual circumstances.,It would have to get in,through a cut in the skin,,and that would be very unlikely.,The Government seemed very,keen to play down any danger,,but the story was now front-page news.,Public attitude changed at that,point, and the media as well.,It suddenly became a really serious,thing because anthrax,,you know, this stuff is dangerous.,The MOD scientists knew,very well how dangerous.,Dark Harvest had targeted,Porton Down for a reason.,""Where better to send our seeds of death,""than to the place,from whence they came?"",With the war on a knife edge,,Churchill feared the Nazis,had developed a biological bomb,,so he tasked his team of top scientists,with finding ways to,harness anthrax as a weapon.,This was highly secretive.,You can get all sorts of,different strains of anthrax,,but this was one of,the more potent strains.,Some of the moral,equivocations of peacetime,had to be put to one side,just to see the potency,and potential of this,form of weapon system.,To see whether this particular strain,would have the effects they expected.,What they didn't know, of,course, was what would happen,if they were trialled in more,realistic field conditions.,They had to find a testing site,that was remote, uninhabited,,isolated but accessible from the mainland.,And that's where you bring,the story up to Gruinard.,Wartime scientists carefully,packaged their weaponised anthrax,and headed 600 miles north.,Transporting this was a risk in itself.,It's a long, long way from Porton,,but it's also a long, long way from,people who could be affected,by an accidental downwind,draft of anthrax spores.,A beautiful and uninhabited little island,was about to witness one of the,first weapons of mass destruction.,In a lot of ways, this island is,the key to some of the big secrets,and what ifs of 20th century history.,It was here in 1942,that the very first scientifically,controlled BW field trials,were carried out.,You have the UK using the Highlands,as a base of operations,for war on a scale that people,hadn't comprehended before.,You're seeing on this seemingly,uninteresting island,the beginning of a kind of,terrifying military power,that was just as great as nuclear weapons.,There were no facilities,anywhere for these tests,,which were, of course, much more hazardous,than comparable chemical warfare trials,,and so this island was picked,especially for its isolation.,What actually happened on Gruinard Island,was a source of mystery and,rumour until the declassification,of this extraordinary MOD film,,which captured every,detail in technicolour.,The sheep are being,put into exposure crates.,The crate is necessary to hold,the animal in the right place,on the layout and to ensure,that it faces the cloud.,It's an incredible historical document,,the cutting edge of science,,and they're documenting,it as they go along,,step by step, so that potentially,they could do this again in future,,somewhere else.,The ambition was to develop,a frightening new weapon -,an anthrax bomb.,It is quite a chilling film.,The aim was to test,,first, whether the anthrax,would survive explosion in the field.,They didn't know that.,And then, would it remain,virulent thereafter?,The men wear ordinary cloth,overalls, rubber boots and gloves,,a respirator with particulate filter,and a cloth hood to keep the hair clean,and reduce risk of leaks.,One of the men in the protective,suits was Allan Elton Younger.,Anthrax is almost indestructible.,Therefore, it was perhaps the best,organism to stand up to the blast.,80-odd sheep were,tethered at various stages,downwind of the likely explosion.,The explosion was done by remote control.,And you see them all lined up.,The bomb was fired,and the wind carries the cloud,towards the line of animals and impingers.,Oh, there we go.,This tiny moment, this puff,of powder, and it really is,,it's releasing death.,It isn't a great bang -,a draft of highly potent spores,moving down on the wind and,causing infection and death,wherever it goes.,They sent up clouds of,bacillus spores into the air,,the sheep inhaled them, and then,they observed the sheep,to see how quickly they died.,On the third day after,exposure, the casualties begin.,Dead sheep can be seen,further down the line.,Also watching from nearby,shores were local crofters.,Did you ever see anything?,Well, I used to watch the smoke,coming down on the top of them.,What do you mean ""the smoke""?,Was it a cloud of...?,A cloud rolling above,the Earth... Uh-huh.,..coming towards these animals.,Where were the animals?,They were staked over there.,I see, they were tied up in a,line, were they? Yes, in a line.,I've heard it said that some,people did see these animals,falling dead when this cloud hit them.,Well, I'm sure I did,the same. Did you?,Yes.,All the sheep in the cloud died.,Postmortem is usually carried,out to confirm appearances.,One useful feature of this,operating theatre is running water.,There's a little waterfall close by.,I think, had I been living,locally, I would've...,..been very anxious to,hear about it. You know,,there's live anthrax being released,less than a mile from your home,,from your farm, I think is,enormously anxiety inducing.,Infected sheep carcasses were burnt,or buried under tonnes of rubble...,..when a cliff on,the island was blown up.,The experiment was deemed a success,,and in 1943, the scientists packed,up and returned to Porton Down...,..but the anthrax remained.,The examination of,soil samples from the layout,showed heavy contamination.,It soon became clear that the contamination,wasn't confined to the island.,A message came down from here that,there had been a case of anthrax,,and that we were suspected.,And this came in clear,,and of course, the great secret,,as far as we were concerned...,I mean, we were told not,to talk about this at all,,and particularly anthrax,must never be mentioned.,And this signal came in clear,,which horrified all of us.,On the mainland, in the six,months after the experiments,,between 30 and 50 sheep, seven cows,,two horses and three cats died.,Government officials promptly,paid compensation to crofters,and persuaded them that the,anthrax infection had come ashore,when a carcass was dumped,from a passing Greek ship.,Porton Down dispatched two men,to Gruinard in another attempt,to rid the island of spores.,We've gone with all our equipment,and just set fire to the heather,,which, by that evening,,was burning right over the island,,a huge cloud of smoke.,Churchill's anthrax bomb was never used.,By the end of the war,,Gruinard had been poisoned,,burned and abandoned.,As months turned to years,,and years to decades,,the deadly spores remained.,The contamination has continued very heavy,over all these years,,and we might have to wait as long,as 100 years for it to get clear.,You don't get any trouble now, of course,,from this long-ago affair, do you?,Well, yes. In this particular,place, yes, I lose sheep,,you know, in the spring.,It wasn't until 24 years,after the experiment,that the warning signs,even mentioned anthrax.,Generations of Highlanders,grew up in the shadow,of the Forbidden Island.,They didn't know exactly,what happened on Gruinard,,but they were warned they must never,set foot on the Island of Death.,Let me get this light on here.,But every year, one local made the,short journey across Gruinard Bay.,'83, '82.,'81.,Every January, we had to go,out and bolt these ones on.,'85, '86, '87, '88...,The island is still so,heavily contaminated with anthrax,that anyone wanting to land,there needs a protective suit,and a seven-and-a-half,month course of injections.,The sign just was to stop people landing.,Anywhere you could possibly get,a boat ashore, there's a sign.,It was under experiment,and landing was prohibited.,My great, great, great grandfather,was born on the island.,When I always hear it,being dubbed Anthrax Island,,I kind of feel, well, there was,something happened there before.,There were people there before,,living there before.,There's no written documents,,so it was just snippets of,oral history that's come down.,They would've been cleared off the island.,They were forced out of their homes,,like most people were back then.,If you say that an island is forbidden,,I think it does come with a,sort of perverse fascination.,This idea that the ground is poisoned,and that it might be,dangerous for you to be there,all adds to that sense,of taboo, of forbiddeness.,There is some kind of,legendary aspect, I think,,to the concept of the toxic island,,the poisoned island, that we all tap into,,and it has some kind,of psychological power.,We were never warned, we were,just told not to go up on the land.,Just stay on the shore.,It was less than £200 a year.,To go to Anthrax Island?,Aye. Yeah. Yep.,It was a lot of money in them days to us.,Yeah. Yeah.,Four decades passed, and,Gruinard was still not safe.,Can you foresee a time when,the island will be free,for people to land on?,No. The spores are surprisingly,resistant to degradation.,Indeed, that was one,of the reasons for them,being selected in the first place.,And we would expect there to,be an area of contamination,for the next tens, perhaps,even hundreds of years.,Four days after bringing infected,Gruinard soil to Porton Down,,the Dark Harvest Commandos,were to strike again.,""That we still have the,problem to worry about today,""is due to 40 years of,total official indifference.,""That's indifference,is about to end."",The Conservative Party conference of 1981,was held in Blackpool,amidst tight security.,But it wasn't only,Thatcher, Heseltine and Heath,making headlines by the sea...,At Blackpool this afternoon,,a second suspect package was found.,It was left in the Tower,buildings near where,the Conservative conference is being held.,The Blackpool Tower was closed,to the public after the discovery,of a tin box believed to,contain soil contaminated...,And the oil, contained in a tin box,,was sent to Porton Down for analysis.,This was found behind a locked door,,and somebody had somehow managed,to get in to that door during normal,operational hours of the tower.,Two packages in five days,meant that this was a campaign.,The letter to the newspapers had claimed,that 300lbs of soil had been taken,,enough for many more attacks.,So this was very alarming. Raising,the prospect of massive escalations,of this contaminated soil was a huge issue.,The MOD considered putting,soldiers on Gruinard to protect it.,They considered sending a,gunboat to patrol the waters,or stationing police on,the shore to keep guard.,But securing Gruinard,seemed next to impossible.,They needed to catch those responsible.,A general alert was,issued throughout the UK,,and a special taskforce,was formed to track down,the Dark Harvest Commandos.,At the time I was based in Inverness,,I was instructed to go and deal with it.,Detective Inspector Colin MacDonald,followed the winding Highland roads,to Gruinard Bay and,the tiny village of Laide.,And I found it quite difficult.,It was a close-knit community,,and they didn't want to,say anything, sometimes,,in case they said too much.,That's the only way that,you could describe them.,At the local post office,,the police found a petition calling,for the clean-up of the island.,One name was of particular interest.,The campaign organiser, John Alick MacRae.,I was involved in,getting this list of names,to draw attention to,the fact that human beings,were surrounding the island.,They wanted to know who,had initiated in the list,,and that is when I was interviewed.,Declassified Government,documents that have lain unnoticed,in the National Archives for over a decade,reveal John Alick was indeed a suspect.,""By way of confidential background,,""the Minister may like to know,that the local Scottish police,""have a strong suspicion that Mr MacRae,,""the organiser of the petition,,""was party to the action,of the Dark Harvest group."",They were convinced because,they suspected a local.,But there were other locals,living close to the island,who had already carried out covert,operations that made headline news.,Here in the vaults of Gairloch Museum,,they hold evidence that,connected one local woman,to a very similar caper.,I've got letter here to,Kay Matheson from the stonemason,who repaired the Stone of Destiny.,You know, it was broken in two,whenever it was stolen.,On Christmas morning, the stone was gone.,The Dean of Westminster,called the disappearance,an act of sacrilege,and spoke of the stone as a precious relic,treasured by millions throughout,the British Commonwealth.,Kay Matheson is from the local area,,became involved with a group of students,who were also passionate,Scottish nationalists.,A nationwide search was organised.,The police have issued the,description of a man and woman,who were seen in a,Ford Anglia car near the Abbey,in the small hours of Christmas morning.,So that was described by one journalist,as the greatest heist in history.,And of course, it was all,over the papers at the time.,And Kay achieved great,notoriety through that.,These initials, JFS, apparently,newly scratched on the chair,,are thought to stand,for Justice For Scotland,,and support the theory that,the stone's disappearance,is the work of extreme,Scottish nationalists.,Inevitably, the local woman,who famously stole the stone,was suspected of stealing the soil.,She obviously had form in that sense,,and it wouldn't have been her,first run-in with Special Branch.,She would have had strong feelings,,I think, about the British Government,using Scottish land in that way.,Behind closed croft doors,,locals speculated and gossiped,about this Highland whodunnit,,but nobody was naming names,,and they still won't.,I think they thought a,woman might be involved.,A well-known activist woman,for other things.,She was definitely for,the Highlands, for Gaelic,,for education.,Who was that?,I don't know if I can,say much more than that.,We really went round,nearly every house in Laide,to see if we could get anything,,but it was a closed shop, really.,I felt that there was maybe,more known in the community,than was being said.,And it was just an instinct.,The police weren't even allowed,to go to Gruinard and inspect,the scene of the crime.,But one person who was,authorised to visit the island,was boatman Stuart Flett.,'85, '86.,In his diary, he recorded,an important breakthrough...,""Police probe new clue,in Gruinard mystery."",..the raiders had used his boat.,It was chained to a tree in the wintertime.,The chain was broken, and a note saying,,""Sorry about the chain, thanks for,the use of the boat - Dark Harvest."",The newly found note helped,the police build up a better picture,of what happened,,and the letter to the newspapers,spelled out in detail,why it happened.,""A team of microbiologists,from two universities,,""guided by members of our local population,,""affected a landing on,the island last week.,""A large number of soil samples,from all over the island,,""with a total weight of 300lbs,,""were securely bagged and,removed to the mainland.,""For the next 12 months,,these bags will be deposited,""at appropriate points."",The really terrifying,thing is that they say,,""This is just the start."" This is,just the start of a campaign,,and that's when I think the full machinery,of the Secret State would get into gear.,The mystery of who,the Dark Harvest Commandos were,played out in a climate of Cold War,paranoia and polarised politics.,The Ceilidh Place in Ullapool,was a forum for the kind of debates,that radicals and left-wingers were having,throughout the 1980s in Scotland.,We do have to make sure that,our view is clearly stated.,We are opposed to nuclear weapons.,We will eventually get rid of them.,People don't expect,any kind of hotbed of,radicalism in the Highlands.,But they're wrong.,Jean Urquhart ran the Ceilidh Place,and formed the local branch of CND.,As a prominent activist,,Jean was interviewed about Dark Harvest,,and it wasn't the local bobby,asking the questions.,It was military police who came up,,and we were quite taken aback.,We were quite naive because CND,was seen as, you know,,as kind of the enemy of the state.,And of course, it's quite a different thing,to the friendly polis in Scotland.,With these, there was no relaxed,conversation about anything.,I mean, it was pretty grim,,I remember that.,You know, there were folk getting,their phone tapped.,And it did, it did have an effect.,In a climate of fear and suspicion,,the Dark Harvest protests were vilified,by the press and politicians.,The Ministry of Defence called their,action incredibly irresponsible,,and they warned anyone finding any,other packages not to touch them.,But the mysterious group,wrong-footed the authorities again,when it was discovered,that the second package,placed in the Blackpool Tower was,actually harmless, uninfected soil.,The MOD were interrogating,,the Special Police Task Force,were investigating, and,the press were digging.,Oh, we went after it big time.,And it was a really exciting story,,of course it was.,It's a story which it,seemed the authorities,couldn't get to the bottom of.,We kind of thought maybe,we had some pretty good candidates.,Iain found out about a hidden community,just across the bay from Gruinard.,This film is about Scoraig,,in the Western Highlands of Scotland.,There are two ways of getting there -,by footpath through the hills,,or by sea,,across what in past times was,called the loch of the many winds.,Scoraig was a small alternative community,inhabited by anti-establishment,environmentalists,,and all off grid.,Topher Dawson, in his boathouse at,the very centre of the community,,is well-placed to observe the passing sea.,Topher set up, without much previous,experience, as a boat builder.,They thought we were all,hippies, which we weren't, but...,..we were different,,and it was kind of homespun.,It wasn't like,,""Let's set up a commune."",It was just people arrived one at a time,and gradually it evolved something.,Well, the house is round.,This is the stairs going up to my,bed, which hangs from the ceiling.,I don't know if it's a bed or a bedroom.,I haven't really worked that out.,People were conscious that we couldn't live,the way we're living.,They wanted to grow as much,of their own food as possible,,to recycle stuff and re-use stuff.,And we were very definitely,against nuclear weapons,,and so by extension, bio-warfare too.,We all kind of disapproved,of it and felt that,it was a pretty irresponsible thing to do.,Gruinard was just a short,boat trip away from Scoraig.,I'd be astonished if the cops,didn't look at Scoraig,,because they were living,an alternative lifestyle.,They weren't terribly impressed,with the establishment in general.,If you wanted to call them hippies,,nonconformist of one kind or another,,well, I suppose that's a,qualification for the kind of people,who might've been in Dark Harvest.,It's called gossip, and a lot,of people don't like gossip.,I mean...,..I suppose there's a,fine line between that,and talking behind people's back.,I got rung up by this reporter,,and he said,,""Come on, go on, you,can tell me. Who did it?"",And I-I couldn't tell him anything.,I do definitely remember coming,home and people saying to me,,""Oh, you missed this,great excitement!"",I do remember that.,Topher cannot account for his exact,whereabouts at the time of the raid,,but he insists he,wasn't on Gruinard Island.,I don't know how many people,could think of an alibi for,,I don't know, two, three days,,40 years ago.,I can't.,You weren't driving down to Blackpool?,Oh, no.,After two months,,the investigation was going nowhere.,Nobody in the wee coastal,villages of Wester Ross,was talking to the police.,They didn't want to say anything that would,take us to a neighbour or to a relation.,There were no clues, no,trace of the soil to be found.,And everyone was thinking,,""I wonder who the hell did that?"",Running possible candidates past.,In our household, there was definitely,a name thrown about of,someone who was local.,Mm-hm.,A neighbour of mine on Scoraig,,he was being pestered by several reporters,,and in the end, he said,,""The person you should speak,to is that Topher Dawson.,""He's got a degree in microbiology,from Cambridge University."",And, of course, that got them very excited.,I don't have a degree in microbiology.,I'm an engineer.,That's what I... I know,nothing about biology.,But he really...,He really dropped me in it.,In The Air Tonight by Phil Collins,As the end of 1981 approached,,it seemed everyone was aware of,the poisoned island of Gruinard.,Dark Harvest put that,story front and centre.,They succeeded in putting,the spotlight on what was,,when you think about it,,an absolute scandal.,They claimed to have 300lbs,worth of infected soil,,and no-one knew where,they would strike next.,# I can feel it coming in the air tonight,# Oh lord... #,A new letter appeared...,..pinned to the door of,the Scottish Office.,You have a kind of heart in mouth moment.,What have they done now?,Instead of threats,,the letter declared that the aims,of the protest had been met,,and there would be no further,action... for now.,They thought they'd done enough.,They were suspending the operation.,Just as mysteriously as they'd appeared,,the Dark Harvest Commandos disappeared.,In 1986, locals again,watched as the men in white,returned to the island.,Today, Gruinard is a hive,of almost surreal activity,as teams of scientists,,vaccinated against anthrax,and dressed in protective clothing,,prepare to return the,island to its natural state.,The Government had to act,and clean up the island.,There's quite a lot of,political pressure on us.,I mean, to be frank, it is,a political embarrassment.,I just remember we were all delighted.,Somebody's done something.,Rows of tubing, not unlike garden hose,,but infinitely more sophisticated,,will spray the infected areas with,hundreds of gallons of sea water,and a chemical, formaldehyde.,11 of the 500 acres of the island,were treated with this toxic solution,,and the Gruinard soil was,again tested at Porton Down.,Hundreds of soil samples,are being analysed,,but it's almost certain that the island,is virtually clear of anthrax,,though there are likely to be a few,deeply buried spores left,,and anyway, no test is foolproof.,The scientists worked to find out,if they had solved,the problem they created.,But for the authorities,,the investigation into who carried,out the Dark Harvest operation,remained unsolved.,And the mystery would,deepen some years later,when an investigative,journalist uncovered evidence,that implicated a,fiery Scottish politician.,It was after I came up to,Scotland that I became interested,in Dark Harvest Commandos,and a Glasgow lawyer called Willie McRae.,William McRae, the SNP candidate,,was born in Wester Ross and,is now a solicitor in Glasgow.,The name of Willie McRae must be linked.,Thinking about who lived in the area,,he was an activist there.,It was the area he had aspired,to represent in Parliament.,And I say that, so far,as Scotland is concerned,,that is a standing disgrace,,and the primary scandal of,over 250 years of union.,He was a great deal more,nationalist than most people,,than most nationalists, you know.,We say it's Scotland's oil.,We expect to control and spend,the revenue on Scotland's oil.,Willie McRae was a vocal,campaigner who successfully opposed,the contamination of Scottish,soil with nuclear waste.,He attracted quite a lot of admirers,because of his skilled opposition to this.,Among those was Adam Busby.,I would only condone violence,as a last resort anyway.,What do you mean by a last resort?,I mean, as a last resort.,I can't really define it.,An incendiary device,addressed to the Prime...,An incendiary device,inside a letter went...,Adam Busby was a violent extremist,,who would go on to organise,a campaign of letter bombs,and intimidation to further the aims,of the Scottish National Liberation Army.,Adam Busby was a person of great,interest to the authorities.,And then you go into a much more,sinister aspect of the whole story.,Adam Busby was a young man with,even more fierce nationalist views.,He was friendly with Willie.,I know that Adam had,very high regard for Willie.,The self-declared leader of,the SNLA claimed that Willie McRae,had been the inspiration,behind Dark Harvest.,Adam Busby told me that this,was the idea of Willie McRae.,Willie McRae's suggestion was what,about giving the English Government,a taste of its own medicine?,They want to dump nuclear waste here -,why don't you dump,anthrax-contaminated soil on them?,Busby, however, was known,for self-promotion,,hoaxes and false claims,,and even for fellow radicals,,he's an unreliable witness.,Adam Busby, now, he said he,was involved with Dark Harvest,,but I very much doubt that.,He claimed a lot more than that.,He claimed everything.,Every dog in the street that was,run over, almost -,we used to laugh - Busby claimed it.,Things that were done by other,groups, he claimed it.,Busby's later actions seem,much less sophisticated,than the Gruinard raiders.,But there is a theory that,the style of the letter,indicates some involvement of McRae.,I met Willie McRae once,,heard lots of speeches by him,,and the dramatic language,,the almost biblical language,,in parts, of the letter betrays,many of his personal traits.,McRae joined a list of possible suspects,,each with different motives,but the same aim.,It's really about getting,the island decontaminated,on behalf of the local community.,After being forced to act,,after millions of pounds,,after years of spraying and sampling,,the MOD declared Gruinard anthrax free.,It was a moment of joy,for the people of Gruinard Bay,and a victory for those,watching from the shadows.,The people who carried out,the Dark Harvest Commando operation,should've been patted on the back,for trying to bring to,the public's attention,what had gone on up there.,I think they're to be commended,,to be quite frank with you.,It was a really effective,and imaginative action,,and it resulted in a clean up,,so I think they're good guys.,And that should have been,the end of this sorry tale.,Extensive testing of the island,soil meant it was deemed safe,for people to once again go to Gruinard.,But there was a final twist,that wrong-footed MOD officials,and raised serious questions,about secrecy and safety.,The second letter that had been,pinned to the door of the Scottish Office,not only signalled the successful,end of the Dark Harvest campaign,,it also contained a startling new claim,that has implications to this day.,That's when they also,revealed that the soil,had not actually come,from Gruinard Island at all,,it had been taken from,the mainland opposite Gruinard.,That actually it's from the mainland.,It's not just the island that's infected,,this is a much more serious risk,,and far more irresponsible.,At the time, the authorities publicly said,,""We do not really have,any evidence to justify,""doing tests on the mainland."",But recently declassified,documents show that Dark Harvest,forced the MOD to reassess,their wartime experiments,and that their secret findings,were extremely concerning.,""On at least one occasion,,a test was performed,""when the surface wind direction,was at the limit of safety.,""It is possible that one or more,clouds of the anthrax aerosol,""passed over the mainland coast."",Forensic examination of these once,secret documents is revealing.,This clearly accepts that,some clouds of anthrax,could've blown over from,the island to the mainland,,and that there was no absolute guarantee,there could be no contamination.,""It would be extraordinarily,expensive to sample and measure,""the area that,could've been affected."",""I do not believe that it,would be sensible to disturb,""the sleeping dog of whether,there is any anthrax contamination,""on either of the two headlands,downwind of Gruinard Island."",So what he's saying is we,should just let it lie,and hope that it will go away.,Timescale over which spores,can exist is 40 to 50 years,,but under some conditions might,even be viable after 200 years.,I think if somebody were,to provide new evidence,that there are anthrax spores in,the environment on the mainland,,then, you know, that would be a concern.,These documents raise questions,about whether the MOD in Porton Down,in the 1980s, in the wake of the,Dark Harvest incident, were honest.,But if it's true, there's been no,serious clean-up of the wider area,,the story's not over.,Today, for those touring the Highlands,,Gruinard is just another picturesque,little island off the coast,,and anyone can go there.,But the legacy of its,past lingers in the mind,,if no longer on the land.,You sort of feel, when you,travel through that area,,this terrible irony between,the beauty of the landscape,and the horror of what has happened there.,It is a real conflict.,The fact that something so,impossibly awful happened,in such a beautiful place does,add a lot of psychological depth.,There are a number of MOD documents,that remain sealed until 2069...,..and the question of who were,the Dark Harvest Commandos,remains unanswered.,Were you involved in Dark Harvest?,No.,And I know nothing whatsoever,about who was involved.,Kay Matheson wasn't backward,in promoting the cause,that she obviously felt,very strongly about.,But by the early 1980s,,she was standing for MP,,and I would suspect that,she was perhaps trying,to keep her nose clean.,I think the Gruinard story,was probably pivotal for us,because it made us,realise, actually, how sensitive,the Government was to groups like ours.,Were you involved,in the taking of the soil?,In an era before eco-warriors,and direct action,,this protest saved at least,one small piece of the Earth.,It's a bit like Greenpeace before,Greenpeace got famous, I think.,Would you have liked to have done it?,I kind of, you know, it would be...,..it would be something,you could be proud of.,You know what I mean?,It's a kind of exciting exploit,,and I just wish I could say that,I was part of it, cos I wasn't.,I wish I had been.,I would love to have been,that person, but I wasn't.,The people of the Highlands,could once again set foot on Gruinard soil.,Apart, that is, from the 300lbs,worth of contaminated soil removed,,put into sacks and hidden,away by Dark Harvest.,To this day, it's never been recovered.,The tourists who follow the North Coast 500,up past beautiful Gruinard Bay,might want to take care,if they spot an old sack of soil,behind a Highland hideout.",https://subslikescript.com/movie/The_Mystery_of_Anthrax_Island-19863080

Me?,In love?,- You weren't thinking clearly.,The case is starting to get personal for you.,- Maja? You have to help me fall out of love.,- Sorry, Lasse, you can't,help anyone fall out of love.,The cement's probably a red herring.,Focaccia must have cement on her shoes too.,- Yeah—,- That doesn't make her guilty.,- True. But we did see the diamond get locked away.,- Yeah but by morning it was gone.,How could it have disappeared?,- I don't know.,- We must have missed something.,- We have to get back to the safe.,- Come on.,Okay. See anything?,- It's blocked.,How're we going to get in?,- I don't know.,The commissioner!,We're wanted!,- What?,There are people everywhere.,We can't even go over the roofs.,We have to find another way.,I think I have an idea.,We have to trick them so they go away.,- You got an idea?,-Spades—,- Hve you got something, or—,- What?,- Go away. Buzz off!,- Are you Tony?,-With y or i?,- We have a message for you.,- From someone named Pandoro.,- Pandoro? But why did he send you?,- We don't know.,But we got 500 kronor to take,a message to Tony with a y and a i.,- OK, so let's have it then.,""Lasse and Maja are at the train station.,All the men to go there."",- That's us.,- And Tony! It's very urgent.,-Yes, yes.,- Hello!,- Hello.

You're not thieves.,What can I do to help?,- We have to look at the safe.,- Okay. Come on.,- Hello.,- Hold it there, Tony!,What're you doing?,- We're on our way to the station.,- You're supposed to be guarding the jewellery shop.,- But you sent us a message.,- What message?,- That Lasse and Maja are at the station.,- I have twelve men at the station.,Why would I want you there?,- But you sent us a message about it.,- I didn't send any message.,Wait a minute—who's guarding the shop?,-No one, I think.,- And who delivered the message?,- It was two children.,- Now you come with me!,That's right.,- How did the thief get the diamond out of the safe?,- It's gone up in smoke, as the commissioner said.,- Listen.,I haven't dared say anything.,Why does anyone even want the thing we locked away?,- What? What do you mean?,- It's a giant diamond.,- Let me see that.,Yes, just as I thought. If that's,a diamond, I'm a skating princess.,- So is Stella Nostra a fake?,- I don't know anything about Stella Nostra.,But that's not a diamond. It's a fughesi.,- A fughesi?,- A fake?,- A phony ?,- But how can you tell?,- The light. The light, Lasse.,There. Swiss diamond spotlights.,They produce maximum reflection,in the diamond's facets.,- Yeah!,The diamond in the box didn't sparkle at all!,- But the one Sara got dazzled me.,- Yeah, me too!,- That means it was real.,- So what was it we locked in the safe?,- It could have been anything.,- Pandoro!,- I can hold him up.,Open up!,Open the door!,- OK Lasse—what could look like a diamond? Glass?,Lasse! We have to think fast!,Muhammad's a lousy liar. We'll get caught!,I didn't think about it at the time,,but the box was wet. Water!,- Water!,- Ice!,- The diamond didn't go up in smoke,,it melted and turned into water!,- Hello.,-Where are they? We know they're here.,Best to tell the truth.,-Otherwise we'll make—,fishcakes out of you!,- They're not here!,You have one last chance,to tell us where they are.,Or we'll all take a little boat trip.,- Yeah, yea—,- Hello!,- Look, there they are.,- Tony!,- With a y? Or i?,- After them!,They were here a moment ago.,- We'll take the jeweller instead.,Wait until Bresaola hears about this.,Okay, what do we have?,- What we have is a fake diamond made of ice.,And a real one that's disappeared.,- And Bresaola's nail files were wet.,What's the connection?,- How do you turn an ice cube into a diamond?,- You file it—with a nail file!,But with single-use files,,you need quite a lot.,So she'd have to use several,before she was finished.,- You have to be good at filing.,- And have easy access to Bresaola's room.,But who would dare to steal from the mafia?,Someone who—belongs to the mafia.,- Someone with cement on their shoes.,Who left traces at the safe,and in Bresaola's room.,- Focaccia.,- Unfortunately, everything points to her.,- No diamond, no trouble.,- What?,- You're right. Focaccia didn't care about,the diamond. She just wanted peace and quiet.,That's why we went to—the wishing well!,- We have to hide Stella Nostra tonight.,You go back to the others. I'll be there soon.,- But what are you going to do?,- Go on, I'll be there soon.,She never said what she was going to do.,Now I understand!,She went to Bresaola's room.,- She must have got the idea for the switch then.,She only needed to grind an ice cube into a diamond.,She knew about the nail files in Bresaola's room.,She must have switched Stella Nostra,on the way to the safe.,- Her dress!,- Her dress?,- The ice cube must have soaked Focaccia's dress.,Because when she came back she'd changed.,- But—where's the real Stella Nostra?,I don't know. We need to talk to Focaccia.,Come on. She's the only one who,can prove we're innocent.,- If we find the dress, we can probably,prove that she filed down the ice cube.,Guards everywhere!,Maybe we should wait a bit.,Until things calm down.,- Yes, take the chance to get some sleep.,Dear Dino. I'm so sorry things have,turned out the way they have.,But I hope there will be a future for us.,I miss you so much.,Your Sara.,Clara. Do sit down.,- Yes.,- I have a suggestion.,- Yes?,- A war could be quite costly for both of us.,- Yes indeed.,So what do you say, shall we co-operate?,Lasse and Maja are our common enemy.,And I have an idea how to catch them.,Like this ...,Where is everyone?,- They're sleeping, I suppose.,Look—Focaccia's window's open.,And there's a ladder.,This doesn't feel right.,Okay.,Focaccia!,- Lasse! This is all wrong. We have to go back!,- Not until we find Focaccia.,- She's not here.,- Wait. Focaccia!,- The dress!,Wet! Look what I've found!,- And look what I've found!,I knew I'd find you here sooner or later.,Don't you think I noticed that,you're interested in Focaccia?,- This time you won't get away.,I'll personally make sure of that.,- Wait, wait!,If you tell me where you've hidden Focaccia,,then maybe I can help you.,- Focaccia's gone?,- ""Focaccia gone?"",Tell me now. Otherwise—Pandoro's,so fantastically good with children.,Focaccia means a lot to me.,- Where is she?,- We didn't know she was gone.,- We came here looking for her.,I promise!,- That's a shame. A great shame.,Yes, yes, you had your chance.,Clara? Hi. It's Bresaola.,Guess what?

She must be.,Pandoro! If you let us go,we can show you where Focaccia is!,- Focaccia? What's he going on about?,- These rats kidnapped Focaccia.,- Kidnapped a child?

Chuecatown (2007) - full transcript,"In BOYSTOWN (Chuecatown), Victor (Pablo Puyol of 20 Centimeters) is a real estate agent in the quickly gentrifying neighborhood of Chueca in Madrid. But he hides a terrible secret; his apartments become available for sale when he murders the elderly women owners and disguises them as suicides. Then Victor quickly refurbishes the apartments to upwardly-mobile gay couples because his ultimate goal is to transform the neighborhood into a hip gayborhood like the Castro in San Francisco and Chelsea in New York. The latest victim s apartment is next door to gay couple Ray (Carlos Fuentes of Kilometer Zero) and Leo (Pepón Nieto of Bulgarian Lovers) who eventually inherit the apartment and offer it as a gift to Ray s mother Antonia (Concha Velasco of Kilometer Zero). But Victor only wants high income gays to move in and he begins a plot to remove Antonia from the premises. Toss in the eccentric Inspector Mila (Rosa Maria Sardà of All About My Mother) and her charmingly clueless son Luis, assigned to investigate the murders, and soon the neighborhood of Chueca is brimming with comic mishaps, sexy seductions and more murders!","A modern, tolerant,,fun neighborhood,has become a space for the young,and a target for main trademarks,selling sophistication.,We've renovated 200 flats,and over 100 stores,,thanks to which we are making it,the ideal neighborhood,of our dreams.,But there's still much to do.,lf good taste is of,vital importance to you,,if you want ideal beauty,surrounding you,,if you need a new life:,Come visit us!,

Hey.,You think maybe,you're overreacting?,I mean, you weren't,this disheartened,before the bracelet discovery.,Isn't this just, I don't know,,a step back, at worst?,Yeah, but can you imagine,if every time someone found,some old photograph in their,grandfather's belongings,that they jumped to the wild,conclusions that I did?,Yeah, but you had to try.,You felt it in your gut, right?,And that's usually,your best compass.,I think my compass is off.,Well, it's not over yet.,I mean, we could still be very,close to finding our family.,Or, you know,,maybe we never will,,but perhaps we've made some,meaningful connections,in the meantime?,Like Ben?,I'm not talking about Ben.,I just wish we had something,for Mom.,Well, you're not gonna give up,,are ya?,Didn't think so.,Sent.,Would you like some tea?,I made an extra cup.,Yes, I'd love some.,Thank you.,It's cinnamon apple spice.,Oh, by the way,,your mom's reservation's all,squared away for tomorrow.,Thank you so much,for doing that.,Looks like you've been,working hard.,How's the farm research going?,It's good. Just sent it,off actually.,You don't seem excited,or relieved.,It's just a delayed reaction.,Also, there was something else,that didn't really turn out,the way I hoped.,Did Cody Samuelson end up,being much help?,Did he recover,his Christmas spirit?,He did, actually.,Yeah. He's been great.,That whole family was so,welcoming when I moved here.,Oh, I assumed that,you grew up here.,You have this feeling,of being from here.,No, I've only been here,six years.,I inherited this,old house actually.,The timing was perfect,and now it just feels like I was,always meant to be here.,I think I know the feeling.,I made this leap all,because of a bracelet,that I assumed was one of a kind,Thanks, but I have to admit,,there was something about being,related to Constance Ferrand,that felt right, you know?,Well, you weren't wildly,off-base.,That bracelet was modeled,on a real bracelet,that Constance actually owned.,Oh, so there is a chance?,Unfortunately, no. I found,something in records.,Maurice's last will,and testament,,which states neither he nor,Constance had any children.,I'm sorry, sweetie.,But, as you know, she could,still be a distant relative,or a family friend which,can be just as meaningful...,It's Christmas Eve.,You're in a beautiful town,with one of the best Christmas,festivals around.,And, you got to learn about,the state's early homesteaders,and moonshiners.,Homesteaders?,Pardon?,Homestead records.,I know this seems conclusive,but I'd like to check out,one last thing.,You said that there's a lot of,records at the county office,in Fernwood?,Yes, but I can't imagine that,they're open on Christmas Eve.,They're open!,Two more hours. Yes!,Beverly, you are a genius.,Thank you so much,for everything.,That is great tea.,Thank you. Thank you.,So, the federal government,gave land to these homesteaders,so there was a specific process,from claim to ownership,that had a lot of,required documentation,,so the information is solid.,And not to mention,chain of title.,So, you are letting yourself,get your hopes up again?,Well, I just, I know,that this is a way,to get some definitive,information.,And I know that this is gonna,sound really weird,,but I swear this morning that,portrait in Beverly's office...,It's like her eyes, they were,telling me to keep trying.,Let's go!,F-e-r-r-a-n-d.,Got it right here.,Her claim is this whole area,,here.,Oh. Wow.,Ok. That looks like it's,the tree farm and then some.,I guess that makes sense.,And after that.,That's odd.,What's odd?,Very odd indeed.,It seems like this claim,never progressed,to certificate of ownership.,So, this land should have lapsed,back to federal ownership.,No, I think that's incorrect.,It's currently owned by someone,named Samuelson.,No, the only land owned by them,is a residential lot,on Oak Street.,Ok.,Yeah, this must have slipped,through the cracks somehow.,So, I'll just put a little flag,on that.,This is gonna get me,to my year-end quota.,Deck the halls,with Christmas bonuses.,No, um, actually,,can you not do that?,Please?,Can we just pretend,that I didn't ask?,I'm really worried this is,gonna make things bad,for someone I care about.,Ma'am, that would basically,be stealing.,From the government.,What just happened?,The tree farm.,The Samuelsons, they don't,actually own the land.,It's probably going,to get taken away.,Well, isn't there some sort of,statute of limitations?,Or, I don't know,,couldn't they just buy it?,No, Cody was already struggling,with his options.,I can't believe I've done this,to him.,It's not like you did it,on purpose, Kyla.,I mean if there's,the smallest upside,it sounds like you really care,about him.,I just messed everything up.,He's gonna hate me.,He has to hear it from me.,I have to tell him.,Hey. I was just thinking,about you.,I was worried about you,after last night.,I have to tell you something.,I have to just say it,before I...,Oh, hey. You ok?,No.,I messed up.,It's ok.,In my research of Constance,I decided that I wasn't ready,to let go,,so I went to Fernwood to look in,the homestead records.,That's a smart idea.,What'd you find out?,Um, that there was an issue,for the deed for this land.,The land that the farm sits on.,Somehow it had slipped,through the cracks,and it was Constance's,,but now it's no one's.,And by looking into it,,I inadvertently alerted the,county to this discrepancy.,I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry,,it was an accident.,- Accident.,- Yeah.,An accident?,What? You think we can just,buy up all the land?,No, god, no, no, no, no.,I know. I know I messed,things up.,I would never do anything,to hurt you or your family.,I just... I'm gonna figure,it out. I'm gonna fix it.,I'm gonna make it right. I...,I need some time. Please.,No, no. No, no, no.

Of course.,- Thank you.,- Good luck.,- Thank you.,- Ok, bye.,- Yeah, good luck.,Oh, Beverly, Beverly!,I need your help.,Oh, sweetie, you know,the records office,is closed on Christmas Eve.,Go enjoy yourself.,No, it's not about me,or Constance Ferrand.,I went to the records office,at the county today,and I ended up causing,a huge mess for Cody.,I was afraid of this.,Land ownership is tricky here,and the last thing you need,is someone digging up records.,It's my fault, I should,have told you.,I have some ideas, or,the beginnings of ideas,of how to make things right,,but I'm really going to need,your expertise.,Can you help me,,so I can help Cody?,Yes. I may even have something!,Ok.,You don't remember,where you put it?,I'm sorry, you just came in,asking about land records,,and one never knows these days.,I'm very protective of Conifer.,- So, what could be in here?,- I don't know.,But, even an informal,paper trail,can mean something for them,hanging onto the land.,There it is!,Oh, all it is is some,scientific study.,This is perfect.,Cody, hey.,Look, I know you're upset,with me,,but I really need you to listen.,I figured out a strategy for,the tree farm going forward.,I am all tapped out,on the future of the tree farm,conversations right now.,Look, I really need you,to hear me out, ok.,This is gonna save,the tree farm.,Maybe even you.,Over the last few days,,I've realized just how special,the Samuelson's tree farm is.,Its innovations,involving sustainability,are a really big deal.,I think it needs to be studied.,Partner up with universities.,Create work study programs,,and then you can,open yourself up,for grant opportunities,and keep the land.,You can run the farm at,the scale that you want to.,You can teach.,Show the world,how special it is,,what you get to do.,Honestly, it's such a good idea,that I'm almost ok with the fact,that I had to nearly ruin,your life to come up with it.,It's a solid plan, Cody.,Please don't reject it just,because you fear change.,Or because you're mad at me.,Beverly has all the details.,She can help you.,Here.,Maybe that can be,your first study.,We found the Silver Scots,Pine studies.,Turns out every time Joseph,wrote something down,,he gave the tree a code name.,Lorraine.,Which makes sense, since you,told me she was so resilient.,I guess the loving nicknames,go both ways.,Anyway, there's your key.,Your treasure map.,Hope you find what,you're looking for.,Mom!,Wow!,Hey.,Hi honey.,Are you ok?,Uh, yeah.

Level Five (1997) - full transcript,"The French computer programmer Laura inherits the task of making a computer game of the Battle of Okinawa during World War II. She searches the internet for information on the battle, and interviews Japanese experts and witnesses. The extraordinary circumstances of the Battle of Okinawa lead Laura to reflect deeply on her own life and humanity in general, particularly the influence of history and memories.","What can these be,but the playthings of a mad God,who made us to build them for him?,Imagine Neanderthal man glimpsing,with this vision in his head:,a flash of city at night,,all motion and light.,He cannot tell what it means,,he has had a poetic vision,,all motion and light,,A sea of lights,,he cannnot unravel the images,
,
,
,that land in his mind,,like birds,,swift, unreachable birds.,Thoughts, memories, visions,are the same to him,,a scary hallucination.,Such was William Gibson's vision,when he wrote Neuromancer,and invented Cyberspace:,He saw a Sargasso Sea,,full of binary algae.,On that image we Neanderthals,grafted our own visions,,our thoughts and memories,,our pitiful scraps of information.,But none of us knows what a city is.,
,
,
,This is the stuff you used to write.,You wrote at night, late,,sitting at the computer,,before you logged out.,I'd find it in the morning,when I logged in.,You had been working at your game,,and I was about to work on my book.,Computer at night, barnow's delight.,Computer in the morning,,tomcat's warning.,You said we were two eights,,eight hours for you,,eight hours for me,,eight hours for us both.,Okinawa was sacrificed!,Why do material objects,display such endless,,willful mockery?,If it could be turned to energy,,the world coud do without oil.,Why is it whenever I ask friends,to taste my Tarte Tatin,,my speciality, my triumph.,all the teaspoons dematerialise?,And why at coffee time,do we stir the sugar with forks?,So shaming.,And why does a monkey,steal one of my socks every night,,just one,,to see me scrabble in the morning,and leave with odd socks?,Shame again.,Not to mention the computer.,Bombs everywhere,,< >.,Type 13 would be prettier,,but it's always type 14.,Is that what general Ushijima thought,when he saw victory slip away?,When war displayed,the stubborn willfulness,of material objects?,All that strategy,,all that loyalty to the Emperor,,and the malignity of objects,stole an army as neatly,as monkeys steal socks.,I thought the Game would,rectify this malignant fate.,The 9th Division stuck in Formosa?,So I create a ""Formosa"" sub-program,,I ask for the 9th Division's intervention.,You're kidding! ""Access denied"".,If I insist,,the sub-program vanishes.,If I insist again,,the system crashes.,The beginning is strange.,Landing April 1st sounds foolish.,It's Sunday, like Pearl Harbour.,The Americans expect a bloodbath,,like in the other islands.,They land on the beach.,No reaction.,No reception commitee.,They reach the Japanese forts,,find them abandoned,,yet intact: the bombs,didn't work.,So why did the Japanese leave?,Ushijima, watching,from the Shuri heights,,waits for planes to decimate,those idiot Yanks,trapped on the beaches.,No planes.,For both sides, nothing,goes as planned.,I'll sort this mess out.,Put the Japanese,back in their bunkers,,bring in planes.,Sounds easier to move symbols,than real planes...,But no. ""Request denied"".,And here I am with my codes,that don't enter,,my access denied,,my type 14 errors...,And my calling on you.,One day I'll give Chris,all this stuff,for him to try to do something.,A game that won't work,,a woman going loony...,We'll see what he can do,,the editing wunderkind.,That's where I came in.,At that point in my life,I was readier for other people's images,than my own.,Laura's challenge fired me up.,I began with their trip to Tokyo.,Like them I loved the city.,And the Game offered me,a new way in WWII.,I'd become so Japanese I shared,their collective amnesia.,As if the War'd never happened.,I feel the Japanese,have changed a lot.,I feel they want to bury,their whole past,,World War II...,Japanese people,tend to avoid facing that issue.,It's a tragedy that's affected,my whole life.,Yet it contains a depth,,a kind of life,so strong and vivid,that today we cannot approach,that kind of intensity.,There's some kind of madness,,in fact,,about WWII.,It's not nostalgia,,I'm not nostalgic,about that era.,But those who lived through it,find something missing today.,Some of that was worthwhile.,Which is not to belittle,the atrocities,perpetrated by the Japanese military.,But having to define who one is,,having to fight to the very end,,means facing,something which alters,your whole perception of life,in the face of something crucial.,I want to tease the computer,,like we used to,,fool about with it,,turn its neurons inside out.,In Logo, for instance,,a noun for a verb.,""Dog"" and the computer,is foxed,,It doesn't know what to answer and,confesses: ""I don't know how to dog"".,""Sardine"":,It doesn't know how to sardine,,Or ""Cauliflower"":,""I don't know how to cauliflower"".,So humiliating for a computer,not knowing how to cauliflower.,""Tortoise"":,""I don't know how to tortoise"".,""Rhododendron""...,""Cake-slice""...,""Eiffel Tower""...,""Shoe"":,""I don't know how to shoe"".,I remember an abandoned shoe,,one night.,It was in a crosswalk,,alone, derelict.,No one had picked it up.,No one had run over it.,Another night,,it was still there.,As if the citizens of Paris,had no interest or found superflous,to deal with abandoned shoes.,Maybe an unknown woman,left her shoe every night,in the crosswalk.,Welcome to OWL.,Optional World Link.,This terminal will give you access,to all available networks:,Radio, television,,news networks,,whether they exist or not,,present or future.,Bits have replaced savings.,Gold and dollar belong,in the past.,Right here, feel the beating,of the heart of the future.,The Knowledge-standard!,Ah, the Network!,That was,Wladimir Zakrjevski's contribution,,the genious of the banks.,The Network's Network, that gave you,a free connection,to databanks worldwide.,In pre-historic times,people used pseudonyms.,Here they wore virtual masks.,Laura spent time cyberlooking,for Okinawa witnesses and informants,,but, like in any other network,,she found all sorts of things.,Rumour had it initiates could,plug into other people's,nervous system. So they said anyway.,Yesterday I had,a strange exchange on OWL.,A guy said:,""Good evening, Michel.,I just took something to sleep.,I won't wake up.,I feel so calm.,Before dying,,I want to make a gift,of the kind my contemporaries,can appreciate.,One last phone call,before I go.,I am well-known, you see,,very well-known.,Tomorrow my name,will be in all the papers.,And yours too, if you say,you're the last person,I spoke to before I left.,So I make this gift.,The last words of...,You'll see tomorrow in the papers,,I'm not fooling, you see?"",I answered:,""I think you're fooling,,because I know about death,,I know it well,,I know it by heart.,And we could still talk,even if you said,you were dead.,Because the man I loved is dead,and I talk to him every night.,Good night, Michel."",The next day there was,nothing in the papers.,At first, I thought,that he was fooling,,that he was a nobody.,But there's a dark space there.,thinking back on it.,Nothing in the press.,But what if the death part,wasn't fooling,,only the fame part?,What if he'd only lied,when he said,""I am well-known"",,to make me believe before he died,he was someone else,,and I deprived him of that pleasure,,one last joy before dying?,And I thought I've never,mentioned you to a stranger before.,He died somewhat mysteriously,after the trip to Okinawa.,For those who love premonition signs,,his last images were shot,in the foreign graveyard of Naha.,He said it'd be good to lie,among the decaying tombs,of the combatants of all the useless wars,,including that of Commodore Perry's.,92 years before MacArthur,,Perry came unasked,to Shuri Castle,,that World War II,would turn to dust,,whilst modernising Japan.,As if this country needed a US soldier,each century to enter a new era.,Beside Perry's tomb he'd,explained Oshima's comment,,his: ""Okinawa was sacrificed!"".,Sute-Ishi,,a term from the game Go:,It means sacrificing a piece,to save a game.,If you cut... the root.,If you cut life at the root.,If you are cut from,the root of life,,you die. If...,In any strategic technique,,you need to consider,saving yourself,and sacrificing,a victory card.,If we speak of Okinawa,with respect to Japan's main island,,such was the sacrifice.,The battle was lost in advance,,a battle the Japanese army,had no chance of winning.,It was inscribed,in the context of defeat.,And because that was the context,,the purpose was to fix the aftermath,,and reinforce the ""Tennosei"",,the imperial system,,which had to survive,to the military defeat.,Another direct consecuence,inscribed in this context of defeat,,was that no effort was made,to protect the civilian population,,so civilian casualties,far outnumbered,military casualties.,It's true that Okinawa,was a horrendous battle.,Nothing remains, no culture heritage,,no culture from the past.,Everything was destroyed,,utterly destroyed.,I who love so much the past,,in Okinawa I feel a deep despair.,In a way, the people of Okinawa,are resentful, even today.,There is a profound,feeling of injustice,on account of those events.,I think the war,isn't over yet.,In conversation, I still mention,the levels,we used to give to people,when we spoke.,When someone came and said:,""I am Catholic, or Communist,,or Anarchist"",,or any other bigotry,,we would say:,""Level One!"",We'd laugh so much!,When they were funnier,,or wittier,,we'd say: ""Level Two!"",But it never went higher.,The Game became,such a standard,that we could do nothing,unless we gave levels,to everything in life.,But nothing ever reached Level 5.,I remember one day I said to you:,""Must one die to get to Level Five?"",She had enjoyed Okinawa.,She had loved the ice in summer.,She had loved Naha, a spiritless,city, apparently,,yet full of ghosts,,and they loved ghosts.,She had loved the jungle figs indoors,,and birdsong at traffic lights,that got the blind across.,It was Japan, yet that Japan,that hadn't lost its memory.,There were cats too,,for they loved cats.,There were tags,,and owls and karate.,And their cult-film: a ghost story.,Seeing together there,was a sign to them,,and they loved signs.,That's when you started,calling me Laura.,We loved the film.,We didn't know about the song yet.,I was amazed you could fall,for an image,,then have a real lady,appear in its stead.,Can one be as lovely as an image?,Can one be as memorable,as a song?,I remember about David Raksin,,commissioned to write a song,over the weekend,for Mr Preminger.,You don't keep Mr Preminger waiting.,He'd got a letter from his wife,which he couldn't decipher.,He wasn't short-sighted,,but something odd inside him,prevented him from being able,to read it.,He used to compose by placing,a sheet of paper,on the piano to focus his attention,,so the music flowed from a void,,not from an idea.,And he took his wife's letter,that he couldn't decipher,and put it on the piano.,Then the notes started to flow.,And as they flowed,,as they fell,,he began to decipher the words.,They said his wife was leaving him.,And me too, when,I decipher your programme,,I don't understand it fully.,It seems complicated,,I'm afraid I'll mess it up,,I'm afraid I'll find,things hidden,that flow out without my noticing.,Like in a storm when there's a fog,and suddenly the sun pierces through,and truth appears.,I'm afraid...,I'll find something's,going to happen there,which I can't see yet,,something that suddenly,will seem as potent as a song,suddenly not ours anymore,,but everyone's to share,,just as Laura's song,has become ours... now.,Can you hear my footsteps?,That summer, a store,hired dancers from Kyoto,,there in the big island,,the true Japan.,Where, in 1944,,they'd sent,thousands of children for safety.,No one asked their parents,,for 4 centuries no one,asked anything to the Okinawans.,The children were put on a ship,and the ship sank.,1000 dead. Even before,the battle started,,Okinawa had its dead,,only they didn't know.,Survivors were told to send cards,saying everything was fine,,everyone had landed safely.,Ten years later, Oshima,filmed the parents,gathered where the ship sank,,to console the souls,,as the Japanese saying goes,,of their drowned children.,Seen from the sky, Okinawa's main island,looks like a beast.,Not a green crocodile,like Cuba,,rather a crouched beast,,ready to jump, to unfurl,into who knows what form:,a lizard, a dragon?,As if all History's fierceness,,was in that island,,where people are so peaceble,they infuriate History,for having something,to do with them.,It's like Julius Caesar,moving to Bora Bora.,Or Napoleon in the South Pole.,St Helena was no fun anyway.,Strange to think that,the first ever mention of Okinawa,was on account of him.,An English Captain came to him,after going around the Pacific,,and described a strange little island,,wherein ""the natives had no weapons"".,""No cannons?"", says the Emperor,,somewhat disgusted.,""No cannons, no pistols,,no muskets,,no weapons at all."",""How do they wage war?"",""They don't.,They're not interested."",Napoleon, outraged,,concluded that people,who don't love war,are most ""despicable"".,So thought the island,,the big dragon,hidden in the island,,ready to pounce like a cat,,like a tiger,waiting for the proper time.,Travellers enraged him,,travellers of all times,,with tales of Okinawan's gentleness.,Gentleness! Is history written,with gentleness?,Do you honour gentleness,when you're a dragon?,So Okinawans hated violence?,They had it coming.,A peaceful isle,out of the world,,out of History, would become the stage,of the bloodiest battle of all time.,A happy, life-loving woman,was chosen to encounter death.,I recognise myself,in that little island,,because my suffering,,my most unique suffering,,my most intimate suffering,is also the most banal,,the easiest to name,,So...,It's irrelevant to give it a name,that sounds like a song,,like a movie,,""Okinawa mon amour..."",The Americans landed,in the Kerama islands.,They bombed Naha from there.,Look, we had a swim,over there yesterday.,I'm sure you've read,about it in the papers,,mass suicide in the Kerama islands...,I read page after page on Okinawa,and I feel like crying.,The only place in the world,,the Nazi camps aside, where people,continued to die after the battle.,The islanders weren't true Japanese,,but were Japanese enough to die.,""No one falls into enemy hands alive,,it is shameful"".,We were imbued with army orders,stating that,,if necessary, meaning,when encountering the enemy,,the first granade was for the enemy,and the second we had to use,for suicide.,Two months later, one of the most famous,images of that battle,showed a little girl,waving a white flag,at the head of a line,of civilians and soldiers.,Okinawa would remember that symbol:,A child survivor of forced suicide,put out to protect an Army in ruins.,See that?,You'll be on American TV.,And because we were convinced,this was what war was,,that everyone was,doing this to everyone,,because they must not shame,,a superior race,,a model for humanity,,and because they were nice,,and because they were helpful,and wanted to do what,was expected of them,,and wanted to prove,Napoleon wrong,,they killed themselves...,in their thousands, whole families.,With a granade, if the Army,has supplied granades,,with sticks if they had no granades,or by jumping off cliffs,,like the women of Saipan,had done.,I'd seen these images before.,In slow-motion you can see,this woman turn back,,and spot the camera.,Do we know she would have jumped,if at the last minute,she hadn't known she was watched?,I remember the man in Paris,,in 1900,attempting a mad leap,with a Batman-like parachute,from the Eiffel Tower.,It's so obvious,,at least it is to me,,that at the last minute,,he knows the contraption,won't work,,he knows he'll die,,but the camera is there.,He can't chicken out,,so he jumps and dies.,The woman in Saipan saw the lens,and knew,that foreign devils,would show the world,she hadn't had the guts to jump.,So she jumps. The cameraman,aimed at her,like a hunter,through his sights,,and he shot her like a hunter.,This is a little book entitled,""The tragedy of Okinawa"".,The print is odd,,with characters spaced,like in a primer.,It's very thin,,the lines are doublespaced.,It's like it intends,to teach how to read,,and how not to read.,No book can explain,how a 16 years old boy,kills his mother,beacause an invisible camera,spies on him,,and he cannot desobey.,The boy's name was Kinjo,,he lived in Tokashiki Island,,where you used to go whale-watching.,What could he tell us now, Kinjo?,What could we say to him?,Know what?,When I began to choke,,literally choke,,among this horror,where everyone is a persecutor,,I put a flag in the program,that'll prompt a quote.,Too bad for those who don't get it.,You know it.,It was in the Keepsake,where I saved sentences for tough times.,Thinking ahead...,It's Rabbi Huna's admonition.,Maybe most people won't understand.,It's the one that goes:,""God always sides with the persecuted.,If a just man persecutes a just man,,God sides with the persecuted;,if a bad man persecutes,a just man,,God sides with the persecuted;,if a bad man persecutes a bad man,,God sides with the persecuted;,and even if a just man persecutes a bad man,,God sides with the persecuted"".,These bullfights, like in Mycenae...,In Spain when there's a bullfight,it's to challenge death,,you stare at the sun,,stare at death in the face, like,in the fascist anthem ""Cara al sol"".,In Okinawa, it's the opposite:,They say that before death,is a time for playing,,not a time for killing.,- It's a brave animal.,- But it's not in shape.,- Can it do better?,- It's really brave.,- It has no luck.,- It's a brave beast.,If some future ethnologist,gets to see these images,,he'll ponder the funeral rites,of the strange tribes,of the late 20th Century.,I'll be pleased to give details.,Yes, it was customary for such tribes,to address a familiar,and protective spirit,known as a computer,to some of them,and as an electronic calculator,to others.,They'd consult on everything,,it kept their memory.,In fact, they no longer had a memory,,it was their memory.,It was accompanied,by a whole ritual.,The ethnologist from the future,doesn't know what he's missing,,by not following me in the morning,,between switching the computer on,and coming later to work on it.,He could send a spy camera,,and see me having breakfast,with two cups,,hanging out two towels,,placing two toothbrushes,in a glass..,Pardon me, dear ethnologist,,this is not really for you.,It's for Gloria,,when she comes to clean for me,,and for passing friends.,It re-assures them.,They think : ""Laura has got someone,in her life. She plays the mistery girl,,but I know the tell-tale signs"".,If they suspected my encounters with you,,they'de be aghast.,In The Girl with the Golden Eyes,,Marsay refers to screen-women,,women you display,to hide the one that matters.,I've got a screen-man,,with my cups,and my towels,and my toothbrushes.,Only he's the hidden one,and you're invisible.,You can't make a better,m?nage ? troi.,Well. Back to the grind.,The Knowledge-standard...,When you saw the knowledge,available on the net,,you could smile.,But that was exactly their game:,have information ever further,and faster.,In past times, to lend,weight to money,,they sought a dense, rare material,to act as a pledge,inside coffers.,They chose gold.,Money became,invisible and volatile,,so the new power needed a pledge,that was invisible and volatile too.,They found Knowledge.,Atoms of knowledge,came through our screen,,It was into Knowledge's black holes...,that fell this century's dreams,of power. This unending century.,The screen tore into black shapes,reminiscent of other forms,,wherein the century,had made the blueprints,for its own suicide,,engraving images in our minds.,Images of ruins:,The ruins of Coventry and,Berlin, of Dresden and Stalingrad.,The ruins of Okinawa.,Yesterday I set the puzzle,as a screensaver.,Very appropriate.,I have the impression that,you left me in a huge puzzle,,with the discouraging thought that,,in the end,,there'd be no image.,Pretty modern.,A puzzle about itself.,Our grandmothers' puzzles were,the Mona Lisa,,the Night Watch.,I imagine a perfect gift,for the century's end,,that might be,an Yves Klein puzzle.,Strategy games are made,to win back lost battles. No?,Did you really think a player would,just repeat history,the whole night long,and learn he could only play,his part one way?,I tried the Marienbad game.,After a few moves the computer said:,""I won already,,but we may go on if you like"".,Death could say that.,The south of Okinawa,is an anthill,with thousand of caves and tunnels,fortified by High Command.,The frontline is at Shuri,,where Ushijima's headquarters were.,With him, General Cho,,a hardline nationalist,,involved in the coup d'etat,in Manchuria in 1931,,the Sino-Japanese prelude,to World War Two.,There is also Colonel Yahara,,a man as reflective,as Chao is loud.,He too plays by the book.,Reading the archives, you find proof,the three of them know:,their mission's suicidal.,The battle cannot be won.,Yet there were bombastic bulletins,and tracts proclaiming victory.,Doubters received drastic punishment.,In April and May,,Cho launched mad counter-attacks.,Since the battle is lost,,samourai spirit is what counts.,Japanese soldiers practising,bayonet drill,on live prisoners,,or choking babies in caves,so the enemy don't hear them,,doesn't sound so samourai-like.,But committing suicide with granades,in the subterranean Navy HQ,is truly in the grand tradition.,But Maginot Lines never hold.,Outside, the US attack progresses.,Another famous photo shows,the Tomori lion,surrounded by infantry men.,I wonder what the first GI thought,when he saw that critter.,The lion still guards,its village,,since its mission was to protect it.,Visitors never fail,to leave coins in its mouth,,for good luck.,They chuck coins in the tunnels too.,In a bunker like this,,Yahara writes in his diary,that before the final rout,,he took the time,to destroy all his papers,and rearrange the furniture,""to leave a good impression"".,I found one Kinjo,in one of your listings,,I was obsessed by that boy,who had killed his family,to obey a tacit order,engraved on his child's mind.,""No one falls into,enemy hands alive"".,The syllables of his name sum it up.,I was disappointed.,That Kinjo is in Yahara's book,,one of the many boys of Okinawa,drafted under the engaging motto:,""By blood and by iron"".,Not even soldiers,,they're just trying to help out,,obeying orders.,Yahara describes going by night,to get sugar-cane, underfire,,for survival.,Then he ran home and,hid under the bed, like a puppy.,Yahara thinks of his own son,and he starts to have doubts,about the War.,But the other Kinjo,,will I ever get to understand him?,I only know it happened,in the Kerama islands,,where we went on a day,so glorious.,A massacre seemed inimaginable.,The view over the archipielago.,""The fractal islands on Klein blue"",,you said,,simple as ever.,Kannon,,Goddess of Mercy's temple,,her statue behind glass,that made her appear,in her place,,in the sky.,There was also,a magical Okinawa weaver.,Unavoidably, one calls,on all those myths,the knotted threads of man:,the Parcae, the Norns,,all the figures devised by men to say,life's thread unravels,and breaks.,Do they spin Kinjo's life still?,What would Kinjo think before,fractal islands and Klein blue?,Before the Goddess of Mercy?,A few visits to Heiwa Dori,,Naha's indoors market,,and you become aware:,it is run by women.,All are connected with the War.,They are widows and orphans.,Sometimes survivors.,Most little girls of that age,experienced mobilization, propaganda,,a feeling that they too must fight.,The nurses at Himeyuri-no-to,became a symbol.,An obligatory tourist pilgrimage,in Okinawa.,It starts with a cheerful song,,which was their favourite.,Then the photo sessions.,And faces peering into a hole,that looks like a simple hole,in the ground.,This is the entrance,to the Himeyuri cave,,site of the 3rd surgical unit,,where 46 girls died suffocated,during the final attack,,when the Army disbanded,the Nursing Corps,and left them to their fate,,with orders not to surrender.,In the local museum,,there's a diorama of the cave,with sound and light effects.,Next comes a ""requiem"" room,with portraits of the 206 pupils,and teachers of the Himeyuri College,,and eye-witness accounts.,As could be expected,,the choice of site was controversial.,Was too much,made of girls,from the Okinawa elite,when others were forgotten?,As if there were privileged martyrs.,This adds more sadness, this competition,of memory.,My dead are deader than your dead.,We had seen that too.,The Game had kept only the faces.,That was enough.,But to understand what happened,,one must climb down into the caves,with rope and a torch,,then turn out the light,and try to imagine,a teenage girl in the dark,,with rotten corpses and,amputation without anaesthetic.,The sound of maggots in live flesh.,and other sounds,,the shrieks of dying men,,the hungry begging,for amputated limbs,to be cooked.,Try to imagine that.,And also the wait for a resolution.,Most likely, liquidation,with flame-throwers.,Soon, Heiwa Dori will get normal traders,like any other.,Until then, the market guards,Okinawa's memory.,Its ladies are grave-keepers.,I wish I could bring good news.,The Network is not,what it was.,You said there is something,irretrievably vulgar about success.,OWL must be a success.,You wonder how some people,plug in.,A few days ago a man,in an Oberon mask asked me,if I was his baby donkey.,I felt a whiff of nostalgia.,I remembered the time when,you were all just weirdos,in Washington DC,,and thought that secrecy,in this overbugged world meant,entering the most open network,,with passwords to discourage morons.,But there's no discouraging morons.,You were part Robin Hood,,part secret society,,You were on raids for information,,like leaving Sherwood for supplies.,Then you retreated back,to your impenetrable lair.,I have to go out too,,to gather knowledge,about Okinawa,,and I feel like a hunted spy,,I'm afraid they're after me.,And I wonder if it isn't true.,Under those pussy-hound masks,,I discern true enemies,,people who want to know too much,or who already know too much.,""Okinawa?,Rings a bell. Wasn't there,a strategy game about that?,Written by some peculiar guy?,Remind me his name..."",Sure I'll give your name!,Now, I don't mention Okinawa.,I sidestep: the end of,the Pacific campaign,,Ernie Pyle's death,,as if Okinawa was a lethal word,,an ""open, Sesame"".

Just as well,,I swear there'd be no audience.,I remember the fear,and I have really experienced the feeling,of being a part of Japan at war.,That is why I particularly feel,,since my job is film-making,,that Japanese war films are rubbish.,They deal only with themselves,,how they suffered from the war,,how brave and painful it was,,They never show the other side.,Once again, Oshima,pointed the way.,Laura went on to study,how each side depicted the enemy.,It was none too pleasant.,We were taught that Westerners,were demons. We were told,if US troops captured us,they'd cut off our noses and ears,,cut off our fingers.,They would drive tanks over our bodies,,and rape our women.,We would suffer horribly, then die.,We were so imbued with all this,that it seemed better,to suppress our loved ones,,than leave them to the enemy,,For them, it would be a consolation,to die by the hand of a loved one.,Filled with this thought,,we lamented and, lamenting,,interrupted our mother's life.,That's where I recognised him: Kinjo.,The boy from the Keramas.,A village elder, a leader,,was snapping off a tree-branch.,I watched him,,intrigued.,Then, on his very hand,,the stick beame a weapon.,As if having a seizure,,he began to beat the life out,of his wife and children,,whom he loved,,using just this piece of wood.,It was terribly shocking,,but telepathically,all of us thought,this was the thing to do,and others began to kill,the people they loved most.,They began with children,,with the weak and the old,,with those who lacked the strength,to take their own lives.,So husbands killed wives,,parents killed children,,brothers killed sisters.,They killed them because,they loved them.,Such was the tragedy,of those mass suicides.,It was a real butchery,,and the waters of the river,where they threw the bodies,indiscriminately,became rivers of blood.,As for my own family,,my brother, who was,two years my senior,,and I raised our hand,for the first time,against the mother who had borne us.,At 19, my brother,could not help moaning.,He suffered so much.,My father went off to die.,We also killed our younger,brother and sister.,Afterwards, he sought,a glorious death in war,crossing enemy lines:,He was captured alongside soldiers,who had called capture dishonorable.,Mass suicides accompanied,the advance of US troops.,Together with Japanese executions,and casualities of war,,some 150.000 civilians died in Okinawa,,a third of the population.,No other group suffered so,,except in the Nazi camps.,Europeans, surviving this,,might have turned to Buddhism.,Kinjo found Christianity.,He became a minister.,He offers his memory,to help others decipher theirs.,He wants Japan to acknowledge,its war crimes,,and mass suicides taught,in school books,,not ignored, or called madness.,He wants what nations and men,are least capable of:,that memory be faced,,and forgiveness asked.,If you look in the Bible,,you'll see confessing your mistakes,and expressing repentance,,cleanses people of their past.,But Japanese mentality,,the way of thought,,considers that errors,committed in the past,remain errors forever.,They cannot be erased.,I decided that,my mission must be,to proclaim the value of human life,to counter the notion,,the ideology of the past,,that held life in such contempt,,for such was the lie they taught.,That was the motivation,for my becoming a missionary,,a Christian minister.,After the retreat from Shuri,,General Buckner,sent Ushijima,,in his Southern bastion,,an offer of honorable surrender.,The Japanese general reacted,with an outburst of laughter.,Was it laughter,,borne on the wind,,that prompted a frontline gunner?,Unknowningly, he aimed,at Buckner,,who was examining the ground,,and Simon Bolivar Buckner,,only US general,to die in combat,,failed to convince his enemies,,and died a few days before them.,It is said that Ushijima prayed,for Buchner when he died.,Then he and Cho,arranged the ending,,the only end they could conceive.,He doesn't know how to harakiri.,You don't say.,Seppuku is not,,in the European sense,,suicide, but the act,of giving oneself death.,The act of living through harshest pain,at the end.,That's what seppuku is.,So to perform seppuku,,you must be in good health,,very well-balanced,,with enough energy,to make a gift of death.,Pulling a trigger is not enough,,nor is swallowing pills,,nor stepping out into the void.,You must touch yourself,to the end,,with living energy.,What of the piety,that surrounds,the tombs at Mabuni Hill?,Hard to believe these quiet people,,these quiet girls,born thirty years later,,are nostalgic for imperial times.,Does sacrifice erase everything?,When you say ""it happened here"",,something deep inside us,resurfaces.,That is why many people come,spontaneously, join hands and pray.,Myself, knowing or learning,the nature of this place,,I'd offer incense and pray.,That's all I need to know.,One wonders what a Japanese general,has in mind when he offers,his life to the Emperor.,Thanks to Yahara,,we know.,The last thing Cho,tells him is:,""Remember the French film,we saw,in Saigon, in '41?"",It was Waves of the Danube,,with extras posing as gypsies.,And the music Cho heard,while disembowelling himself,,watching the horizon for the last time,,was Black Eyes.,Am I going mad?,I used to see you,everywhere,,I recognised you from afar,,I went back to the places we loved,,the Jardin des Plantes,,the little farm,at the Bois de Boulogne,,the shore beneath the Golden Gate,where Kim Novak feigns suicide,in Vertigo...,I'd see a man from behind,,looking at parrots,,or sitting among goats,,or leaning against a rail,,and it would be you.,Then I'd come closer,,he'd turn round, be someone else.,I'd wonder how anyone,could replace you so fast.,In my moment of distraction,,not more than a split second...,Now it's the same in the Network.,Someone calls, it's you,,I know by tell-tale signs,,a special word only we would use.,Then I'd question him,,and he'd shy away,,not like you anymore.,Then another sign.,Is this a game?,Is it you teasing me?,One day, one woman,knows too much,,too much about you, about me,,about the Game, about everything.,We are plugged into the masks gallery.,I ask her to show me hers,and on the screen I see this.,The end of the battle is written,in the deep, by Okinawa,,where Oshima,,surveyor of memories,,filmed underwater graveyards.,Okinawa was,the Japs' sute-ishi,,their sacrificial pawn.,If the price was high enough,,the US,would shrink from invading,Japan's main island,and peace could be made.,The reality was,,it made the case,for the Atom Bomb.,Without Okinawa's resistance,,Hiroshima would not have been,,and the century would've been different.,Which means that in all respects,,our lives were fashioned by events,that took place in that little island,,between the moment,when Kinjo killed his family,,and general Ushijima's,self-death.,Now Laura saw,the Game couldn't change history.,It would repeat it, in a loop,,with respectably futile obstinacy.,Storing the past so as not to revive it,was sheer 20th Century.,She was detached now,,as if she'd come to a limit;,The Game was not hers anymore,,nor was History.,I knew she spoke,with Masks at night.,I asked what she wanted,,she responded:,Level Five, of course,,in a tone that made you think,she was cured, as if for her,the War was over.,Naturally, I was wrong.,Last night: fun dialog,with a mask.,A Harfang owl mask,,so I listened.,Having some knowledge about Harfang,,in our days,,shows some culture.,Disappointing, as usual.,When he went for a date,I really got him:,""Think of all the time we've saved,in just five minutes:,Six months of passion,,two years of jealousy,,four years' infidelity,,eight of misunderstandings,,reconciliation one spring,,one summer of fighting,,one autumn of breaking up,,one winter of dispair,,just work it out.,Bye and thanks,for the time saved"".,He found nothing to say.,And you?,Shall I thank you?,The list I gave him, so as to shine,,did time have it in store for us?,I see me, in ten years,,without you,,reading in the paper you've died,,a feeling of something already seen,,already lost,,the faraway echo of something,I don't know,,your absence now,which I wouldn't have known,,but would have felt within me,,as if my programmer foresaw it all,,what happened, what,might have happened.,Like when you search for a word,that escapes you.,""I had it on the tip of my tongue"".,I'd have your death,on the tip of my memory,,I'd have thought:,""There was a time when..."",But then there was another time,,the time of my list,,from jealousy to deceit,,and that time would mute our time,,mute the echo of our life.,Everything would have been,as though through a wall,,barely audible...,Like when rescuers search,through a wall of rubble,,they always come too late.,And you?,What would you have kept?,One day my image would,begin to blur,,you'd realise the scraps,of words,,scraps of life,filling your memory,,were shifting out of focus.,Must I thank you too?,Thank you for this gift?,A life in which,there wasn't enough time,for something mediocre to slip in,,neither lies nor cruelty.,So swift that the ordinary gremlins,,that sneak into everyday life,,haven't had the chance to get to us.,They met a shut door:,""Closed for a death"".,So annoying for them.,Nothing for them in the will.,A life, a body, untouched,,on which I never saw,the first signs,of lovelessness,,abandon,or relinquishment.,A real fairy-tale, one of them,falls asleep,and never changes.,There's no greater gift.,Shall I thank you?,I thank you.,Thank you.,Thank you.,I never saw Laura again.,The workshop seemed unchanged,,the machines were on,,as if she had just,stepped out.,Our loyal screensaver cat,kept watch.,and the OWL mail page,was open.,Without thinking, I typed in her name.,He didn't know that
